									<p class = "tab"> The first cyber crimes appeared in the 1970s and 1980s. Those crimes included digital piracy, cyberstalking, cyberpornography, and internet pedophilia.
									But in the first and second decades of the 20th century, cyber related crimes expanded. But crimes evolved as technology did and new forms of cyber crimes were introduced.
									Those now include cyberbullying, sexting, identify theft, phishing, and so forth. Wall(2007) differentiates “three generations” of computer crimes.
									The criteria for determining which crime is a cybercrime is labeled as “computer crimes”.
									Leman-Langlois claims that cybercrimes don’t even exist. She claims that its simply a convenient way to refer to a set of concepts.
									Strickwerda(2013) defines cybercrimes as any new or different human act carried out through the use of computers or computer networks.</p>
									
									<h2>Counter Hacking</h2>
									<p class = "tab">Another term widely used for counter hacking is active defense hacking. Individuals and corporations use counter hacking to direct attacks at those suspect of causing the original hacker attacks. Usually used as an act of retaliation. </p>
									<p class = "tab">Companies and agencies train people to become ethical hackers to perform counter hacking measures. CEH are trained and certified not only in the use of defense but also in offensive preemptive strikes.</p>

									<h2>Types of Cybercrimes and cyber-related crimes</h2>
									<p class = "tab">Jargon File defines a hacker as “an expert or enthusiast of any kind.” Wall(2007) uses the expression of white hats and black hats to distinguish between two types of hacking behavior.</p>
									<p class = "tab">There are two types of hackers. White hat hackers and Black hat hackers. White Hats are hackers that code and hack without malicious intent or a hired to hack for defensive companies. While Black hat hackers are those who crack code and code with malicious intent directed at anything or anyone.</p>
									<p class = "tab">The term hacker originated in the 1980s to be used a term to criminals using computers. But hackers began calling destructive computer users crackers. 
									Jargon claims that a cracker is one “who breaks security on a system”. Which then they engage in theft and vandalism once they have gained access to computer systems.
