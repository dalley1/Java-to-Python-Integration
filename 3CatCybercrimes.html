												<h3>Cyberpiracy</h3>
												<p class = "tab">is using cyber tech in unauthorized ways to reproduce copies of proprietary information or distributing that information on the network. Cyberpiracy also goes hand-to-hand with Cybersquatting, which is the act of registering a domain name in which is similiar or relative to a company, claim, or business that you do not own or have any ties to. 
												Then processing to sell that same domain to the actual existing company owner. Cyberpiracy can also be when someone uses a brand name name to bait traffic to another website. These usually used for ad websites that need to generate traffic for affiliate links.</p>

												<h3>Cybertrespass</h3>
												<p class = "tab">is using cybertech to gain unauthorized access to oneâ€™s computer system or a password protected site. This includes connecting to any device without permission whether with malicous intent or not. 
												Cybersquatting is a common act that criminals use in regards to commiting one of these three cybercrimes. In terms of Cybertrespassing, criminals trespass onto websites using email spoofing, and phishing to gain access, then allowing them to perform acts such as cyber squatting, identity theft and more. </p>

											<div class="column">
												<h3>Cybervandalism</h3>
												<p class = "tab">is using cybertech to unleash one or more programs that disrupts transmission of electronic information or destroys data in a computer or causes damages to the computer itself. 
												We can think of it as graffiting a wall, or keying someone's car in the physical world but in the internet world that would be defacing someone's Wikipedia page.(We all know about that).
												Many types of cyber vandalism exist today, even some that we have encountered before such as, DDOS attacks, malware attacks, and webpage hacking. We have also seen cybervandalism being used in election races, to sabotage opposing running parties.</p>
