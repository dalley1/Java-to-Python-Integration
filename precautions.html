									better prepare and protect ourselves. Cybercrimes will not always come in the same manner hence why protection is evolving just as fast as the threats. There are many practices and procedures that can be used
									create the solution needed for any individual's practice.</p>

									<h2>Downsides of not taking precautions</h2>
									<p  class="tab">There are many downsides to not taking precautions in regards to cybercrimes or cyber threats. When in terms of businesses being victims of cyber attacks, they no longer just focus on themselves. They have customers, and employees whos information would at risk of exposure. But there are some companies that would rather risk their company name and integrity to save themselves.</p>
									<p  class="tab">In 2014 Starwood Hotels was affected by a data breach, but this was not discovered until eight months later. In 2016 after Marriot aquired Starwood they decided that it was time to finally call in investigators to look at the data breach that had occured at Starwood. The investigators found that RAT malware was left on the computers and allowed hackers to gain remote access after the user successfully logged into the desktop.</p>
									<p  class="tab">If Starwood Hotels would have taken the necessary precautions to get their systems analyzed I believe that this issue would have been illeviated or it would not have resulted in the gigantic mess they had. The data breach resulted in around 500 million customer's personal information had been taken, which then led to countless lawsuits being filed against Marriott and Starwood.</p>
